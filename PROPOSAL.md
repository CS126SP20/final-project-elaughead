# CS 126 Project Proposal: Tetris

Author: Emily Laughead

For this project, I would like to make a working form of Tetris.

I love playing video games, but I've never had the chance or been confident enough to code a game before. I think that it would be a fun project to work on, and keep me motivated to see it eventually work. I'm also a big fan of tetris, and I think it would be a fun project to keep me motivated.

I am planning on using [ImGui](https://github.com/simongeilfus/Cinder-ImGui) for this project. It is easy to integrate into CInder as it is a Cinder block, and it is a good GUI designer.

For the first week, I'll mostly be working on getting the correct libraries downloaded and creating a loose structure of what I want my game to be. 
Week 2 will be more code-heavy, as I begin to develop the game even further, mostly creating the classes that I plan on implementing code into.
Week 3 will be dedicated to most of the coding, developing the GUI, and making the finishing touches.
If I end up finishing early, I will try to implement some sort of different game mode for my project 
(Hard mode, or in the case of tetris, some way to increase the speed of the tetriminos falling.)
