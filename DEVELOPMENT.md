# Development

---

04/22/20 - attempted to get ImGui up and running for about an hour and a half. Got frustrated and stopped.

04/23/20 - code review. talked with code mod about how to possible fix my issues with ImGui. Decided to delete my project and cinder-imgui and re-install.

04/26/20 - messed around with ImGui some more. Was finally able to get it up and running correctly after making some changes.

04/28/20 - committed and pushed current work to Github.

04/29/20 - planning on doing a lot of work today. I want to create most, if not all, of the game UI today if possible.
    - helped someone out on piazza who was having trouble with ImGui.

04/30/20 - committed & pushed code that I forgot to last night. Between yesterday and today, I've created the pieces and their logic, and I've begun to make new classes for other aspects of the app.
Also the person I was helping on Piazza finally got ImGui to work! yay

05/03/20 - starting writing more code for the app, still focusing on functions and not the app itself.

05/04/20 - got most of the regular functions done, beginning to start the GUI implementation.

05/05/20 - lots of work done today, mainly in my_app.cc/.h. Not much work with ImGui yet, but I'll get there soon.

05/06/2020 - dawn of the final day, 24 hours remain.
began working at around 11am, currently 10:30pm. I've done so much work today, mostly on my_app.cc. 
No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get the pieces to show up on my screen. I had friends look at my code,
and they couldn't figure it out either. I feel like I got so close to finishing.
Added comments and wrote tests.
