04/22/20 - attempted to get ImGui up and running for about an hour and a half. Got frustrated and stopped.

04/23/20 - code review. talked with code mod about how to possible fix my issues with ImGui. Decided to delete my project and cinder-imgui and re-install.

04/26/20 - messed around with ImGui some more. Was finally able to get it up and running correctly after making some changes.

04/28/20 - committed and pushed current work to Github.

04/29/20 - planning on doing a lot of work today. I want to create most, if not all, of the game UI today if possible.
    - helped someone out on piazza who was having trouble with ImGui.

04/30/20 - committed & pushed code that I forgot to last night. Between yesterday and today, I've created the pieces and their logic, and I've begun to make new classes for other aspects of the app.
